# Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium - Machine Learning (Regression)

Phase equilibrium, and in particular vapor/liquid-equilibrium (VLE), is important for many process engineering applications. The thermodynamic basis for phase equilibrium is the same as for chemical equilibrium, namely that the Gibbs energy *G* is minimized at a given *T* and *p*.
