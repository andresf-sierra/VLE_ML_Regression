# Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium - Machine Learning (Regression)

The liquid–vapour equilibrium (LVE) is a pillar of process thermodynamics, as it controls the design and operation of separation equipment such as columns: distillation columns, equilibrium reactors, condensers, among others. In particular, the water-ethanol binary system is one of the most studied equilibria in chemical engineering: it presents an azeotrope at atmospheric pressure, is the basis of multiple industrial processes (production of bioethanol, alcoholic beverages, solvents) and constitutes a reference case for validating thermodynamic models such as [UNIFAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIFAC) and [NRTL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-random_two-liquid_model).
